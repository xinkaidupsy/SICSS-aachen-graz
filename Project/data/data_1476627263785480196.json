The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos"},{"start":86,"end":109,"url":"https://t.co/7t78cNDQk5","expanded_url":"https://khub.net/documents/135939561/430986542/Effectiveness+of+COVID-19+vaccines+against+Omicron+variant+of+concern.pdf/f423c9f4-91cb-0274-c8c5-70e8fad50074","display_url":"khub.net/documents/1359…","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://khub.net/documents/135939561/430986542/Effectiveness+of+COVID-19+vaccines+against+Omicron+variant+of+concern.pdf/f423c9f4-91cb-0274-c8c5-70e8fad50074","images":{}},{"start":111,"end":134,"url":"https://t.co/jNtox5sshm","expanded_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1042367/technical_briefing-31-10-december-2021.pdf","display_url":"assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/upl…","unwound_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1042367/technical_briefing-31-10-december-2021.pdf","images":{}},{"start":136,"end":159,"url":"https://t.co/kqkVZq2XpN","expanded_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.13.21267670v1","display_url":"medrxiv.org/content/10.110…","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.13.21267670v1","images":{}},{"start":161,"end":184,"url":"https://t.co/VupFRxiftP","expanded_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.472252v1.full.pdf","display_url":"biorxiv.org/content/10.110…","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.472252v1.full.pdf","images":{}},{"start":186,"end":209,"url":"https://t.co/m3F5VlxCYQ","expanded_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267755v1","display_url":"medrxiv.org/content/10.110…","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267755v1","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1543253171040051200/dQxXInjO?format=png&name=orig","width":252,"height":252},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1543253171040051200/dQxXInjO?format=png&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"title":"mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine boosters induce neutralizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant","description":"Recent surveillance has revealed the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.1/B.1.1.529) harboring up to 36 mutations in spike protein, the target of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. Given its potential to escape vaccine-induced humoral immunity, we measured neutralization potency of sera from 88 mRNA-1273, 111 BNT162b, and 40 Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients against wild type, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We included individuals that were vaccinated recently (<3 months), distantly (6-12 months), or recently boosted, and accounted for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinated individuals. However, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron only 4-6-fold lower than wild type, suggesting that boosters enhance the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, we find Omicron pseudovirus is more infectious than any other variant tested.
