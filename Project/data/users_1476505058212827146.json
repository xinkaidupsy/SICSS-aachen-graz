The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"},{"start":284,"end":307,"url":"https://t.co/tDnpi1trRU","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/virusmonologues/status/1476221647417921536/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/tDnpi1trRU","images":{},"media_key":"3_1476211548859293701"}],"hashtags":[{"start":43,"end":51,"tag":"Omicron"},{"start":250,"end":264,"tag":"Getvaccinated"},{"start":265,"end":283,"tag":"GetthoseTcellsnow"}],"mentions":{}},"author_id":"765632223248846848","conversation_id":"1476221647417921536","created_at":"2021-12-29T16:00:42.000Z","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476221647417921536","text":"We have new results on T cell responses to #Omicron, and its good news! \nPaper submitted for peer review &amp; preprint: \nhttps://t.co/40Y8obKzkK\n\nüì¢TL;DR: Most of your T cell responses from vaccination or previous infection still recognise Omicron. \n#Getvaccinated #GetthoseTcellsnow https://t.co/tDnpi1trRU","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476211548859293701"],"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":4831,"reply_count":820,"like_count":18699,"quote_count":144},"entities":{"annotations":[{"start":32,"end":39,"probability":0.7032,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Haldwani"}],"urls":[{"start":88,"end":111,"url":"https://t.co/Ty7EqSkqPL","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1mnGedPLrdaKX","display_url":"twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1‚Ä¶","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1552285592708296704/vGtGmFAw?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1552285592708296704/vGtGmFAw?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Narendra Modi","description":"Speaking at a public meeting in Haldwani where development works are being inaugurated.","unwound_url":"https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1mnGedPLrdaKX"}],"hashtags":{},"mentions":{}},"author_id":"18839785","conversation_id":"1476476893612310529","created_at":"2021-12-30T08:54:57.000Z","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Media Studio","id":"1476476893612310529","text":"Speaking at a public meeting in Haldwani where development works are being inaugurated. https://t.co/Ty7EqSkqPL","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"lang":"hi","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":7,"reply_count":0,"like_count":8,"quote_count":1},"entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":[{"start":260,"end":279,"tag":"ExtraAttemptForAll"}],"mentions":{}},"author_id":"911453855178788865","conversation_id":"1476491162244452356","created_at":"2021-12-30T09:51:39.000Z","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter for Android","id":"1476491162244452356","text":"‡§∏‡§∞‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•á ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§è ‡§ú‡§ø‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§π‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∞‡•ã‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¶‡•å‡§∞‡§æ‡§® ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ\n ‡§õ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§∏‡§¨‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§ú‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§π ‡§•‡•á\n ‡§™‡•â‡§≤‡§ø‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø ‡§õ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§â‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•ã‡§ö‡•á‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§â‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á #ExtraAttemptForAll","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":900,"reply_count":222,"like_count":5380,"quote_count":411},"entities":{"annotations":[{"start":0,"end":10,"probability":0.9938,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Dave Doeren"},{"start":34,"end":37,"probability":0.9855,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"NCAA"},{"start":54,"end":65,"probability":0.3841,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"Holiday Bowl"},{"start":86,"end":89,"probability":0.8989,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"NCAA"}],"urls":[{"start":177,"end":200,"url":"https://t.co/SYjD5J3Tq4","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/PackPride/status/1476339545784336392/video/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/SYjD5J3Tq4","media_key":"7_1476339446740049920"}],"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":13,"end":25,"username":"StateCoachD","id":"983797189"}]},"author_id":"46430342","conversation_id":"1476339545784336392","created_at":"2021-12-29T23:49:11.000Z","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476339545784336392","text":"Dave Doeren (@StateCoachD) on the NCAA not ruling the Holiday Bowl as a forfeit: ‚ÄúThe NCAA stands for No Clue At All in my opinion.
