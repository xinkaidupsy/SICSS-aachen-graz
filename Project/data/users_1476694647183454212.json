The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables.

The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476665470220709897","author_id":"1574782297","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"Here it is the magic bullet!\nThe Omicron cold is being defeated by cross reactive T-cell immunity not vaccines, as witnessed in South Africa.\nCovid19 is dead, long live natural immunity! \nhttps://t.co/xysM7wAk94","created_at":"2021-12-30T21:24:17.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":92,"reply_count":7,"like_count":261,"quote_count":4},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476445160129114112","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"entities":{"annotations":[{"start":12,"end":13,"probability":0.7561,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"US"},{"start":76,"end":84,"probability":0.4771,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Americans"}],"urls":{},"mentions":{},"hashtags":[{"start":131,"end":139,"tag":"COVID19"}]},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476445160129114112","author_id":"86970530","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"Life in the US in Jan-Feb 2022 is going to be almost unrecognizable to most Americans.
