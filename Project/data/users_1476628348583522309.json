The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables.

Within a month, Omicron is dominating over Delta variant in several countries probably due to immune evasion. It remains unclear whether vaccine-induced memory responses can be recalled by Omicron infection. Here, we investigated host immune responses in the first vaccine-breakthrough case of Omicron infection in Hong Kong. We found that the breakthrough infection rapidly recruited potent cross-reactive broad neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against current VOCs, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron, from unmeasurable IC50 values to mean 1:2929 at around 9-12 days, which were higher than the mean peak IC50 values of BioNTech-vaccinees. Cross-reactive spike- and nucleocapsid-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were detected. Similar results were also obtained in the second vaccine-breakthrough case of Omicron infection. Our preliminary findings may have timely implications ","unwound_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.27.474218v1"},{"start":280,"end":303,"url":"https://t.co/6uqfYEU3aR","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/CristinaDragani/status/1476492506879561729/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/6uqfYEU3aR","images":{},"media_key":"3_1476296156296753157"}],"hashtags":[{"start":26,"end":34,"tag":"Omicron"},{"start":35,"end":45,"tag":"infection"},{"start":143,"end":151,"tag":"vaccine"},{"start":180,"end":189,"tag":"variants"},{"start":197,"end":209,"tag":"coronavirus"}],"annotations":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476296156296753157"]},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","author_id":"2791988124","created_at":"2021-12-30T15:45:00.000Z","id":"1476580085683695618","conversation_id":"1476580085683695618","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":81,"reply_count":13,"like_count":237,"quote_count":8},"text":"Ils comptent tous les décès ‘avec covid’ comme des décès de la covid.\n\nMais aussi les patients positifs à l’hôpital comme des patients covid même s’ils ont été hospitalisés pour d’autres raisons.\n\nC’est comme ça qu’ils manipulent les chiffres pour exagérer la pandémie. https://t.co/emB8B11PjN","possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"fr","entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":[{"start":270,"end":293,"url":"https://t.co/emB8B11PjN","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/anthonyfurey/status/1476282231580672000","display_url":"twitter.com/anthonyfurey/s…"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"quoted","id":"1476282231580672000"}],"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","author_id":"1385241954494070789","created_at":"2021-12-30T10:19:22.000Z","id":"1476498138508759043","conversation_id":"1476498138508759043","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":13,"reply_count":210,"like_count":564,"quote_count":12},"text":"Explain your 2021 in one word ??","possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","author_id":"3555130720","created_at":"2021-12-30T17:41:09.000Z","id":"1476609314014048269","conversation_id":"1476609314014048269","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":43,"reply_count":10,"like_count":161,"quote_count":9},"text":"Pinal 😅 the first Algerian sheep to perform a fashion show \nBy : el_moustach &amp; Oran fashion week https://t.co/1YOLNwWS4g","possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":[{"start":101,"end":124,"url":"https://t.co/1YOLNwWS4g","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/SimplyAlgeria/status/1476609314014048269/video/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/1YOLNwWS4g","media_key":"7_1476608869082218501"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":["7_1476608869082218501"]},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","author_id":"561975460","created_at":"2021-12-29T20:17:25.000Z","id":"1476286253079351296","conversation_id":"1476286253079351296","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":129,"reply_count":241,"like_count":1489,"quote_count":204},"text":"Top 25 Most Hated Teams In College Football \n\nRight Now https://t.co/E3CVFeqYng","possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":[{"start":56,"end":79,"url":"https://t.co/E3CVFeqYng","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/BigGameBoomer/status/1476286253079351296/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/E3CVFeqYng","media_key":"3_1476286141942972424"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476286141942972424"]},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","author_id":"242651047","created_at":"2021-12-30T06:08:54.000Z","id":"1476435103601643521","conversation_id":"1476435103601643521","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":4,"like_count":56,"quote_count":0},"text":"My brain cannot cope https://t.co/Ob4GIoYDyF","possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":[{"start":21,"end":44,"url":"https://t.co/Ob4GIoYDyF","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/mahwashajaz_/status/1476435103601643521/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/Ob4GIoYDyF","media_key":"3_1476435094026043393"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476435094026043393"]},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","author_id":"237845487","created_at":"2021-12-30T12:25:24.000Z","id":"1476529852970848263","conversation_id":"1476529852970848263","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":17003,"reply_count":2899,"like_count":115978,"quote_count":885},"text":"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but contracting Covid despite being fully vaccinated is no shame.
