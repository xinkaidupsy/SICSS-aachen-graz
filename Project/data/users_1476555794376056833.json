The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"},{"start":284,"end":307,"url":"https://t.co/tDnpi1trRU","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/virusmonologues/status/1476221647417921536/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/tDnpi1trRU","images":{},"media_key":"3_1476211548859293701"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":{},"hashtags":[{"start":43,"end":51,"tag":"Omicron"},{"start":250,"end":264,"tag":"Getvaccinated"},{"start":265,"end":283,"tag":"GetthoseTcellsnow"}],"cashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1476221647417921536","lang":"en","text":"We have new results on T cell responses to #Omicron, and its good news! \nPaper submitted for peer review &amp; preprint: \nhttps://t.co/40Y8obKzkK\n\nüì¢TL;DR: Most of your T cell responses from vaccination or previous infection still recognise Omicron. \n#Getvaccinated #GetthoseTcellsnow https://t.co/tDnpi1trRU","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2066,"reply_count":137,"like_count":5218,"quote_count":536},"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476221647417921536","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"765632223248846848","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476211548859293701"],"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-30T11:53:31.000Z","entities":{"urls":[{"start":172,"end":195,"url":"https://t.co/L3QArS4fwr","expanded_url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-59824150","display_url":"bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-‚Ä¶","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-59824150"}],"annotations":[{"start":0,"end":6,"probability":0.9436,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Epstein"},{"start":9,"end":22,"probability":0.8808,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Epstein Island"},{"start":25,"end":38,"probability":0.7759,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Lolita Express"},{"start":41,"end":57,"probability":0.9842,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Ghislaine Maxwell"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1476521829057638401","lang":"en","text":"Epstein, Epstein Island, Lolita Express, Ghislaine Maxwell and the sex-trafficking was a conspiracy theory for years, now it‚Äôs in the msm and on TV it‚Äôs suddenly ‚Äòreal‚Äô. üôÑ https://t.co/L3QArS4fwr","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":456,"reply_count":125,"like_count":1799,"quote_count":27},"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476521829057638401","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"20172153","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-30T04:57:25.000Z","entities":{"urls":{},"annotations":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":10,"username":"Harvard2H","id":"1052240134438039553"},{"start":11,"end":26,"username":"rising_serpent","id":"879548970082721792"}],"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1476414133046329350","lang":"en","text":"@Harvard2H @rising_serpent can you elaborate on this? thanks","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":2,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476417116853133313","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"1680843128","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476416515025129475"}],"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"in_reply_to_user_id":"1052240134438039553","geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-29T22:20:51.000Z","entities":{"urls":{},"annotations":{},"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1476317317428613120","lang":"en","text":"Found out today I have a blood clot In my leg thanks Covid booster ü§ù","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":5589,"reply_count":1531,"like_count":20052,"quote_count":508},"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476317317428613120","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"953713744600805376","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-29T21:07:09.000Z","entities":{"urls":[{"start":249,"end":272,"url":"https://t.co/ovlgEUYriX","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1475839914910666767","display_url":"twitter.com/PeterHotez/sta‚Ä¶"}],"annotations":[{"start":30,"end":38,"probability":0.9933,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Dr. Hotez"},{"start":62,"end":75,"probability":0.7538,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"Texas Children"},{"start":94,"end":99,"probability":0.7437,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"Pfizer"},{"start":105,"end":111,"probability":0.5286,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"Moderna"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":[{"start":151,"end":159,"tag":"COVID19"}],"cashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1476298770002243584","lang":"en","text":"Not getting discussed enough: Dr. Hotez and his colleagues at Texas Children's have done what Pfizer and Moderna won't‚Äî developed a safe and effective #COVID19 vaccine, then transferred the patent to manufacturers in the developing world.
