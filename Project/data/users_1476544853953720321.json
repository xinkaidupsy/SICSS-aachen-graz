Each day the junta continues to commit grave crimes, including crimes against humanity, yet Macron and Biden take no action over oil and gas revenues generated by companies including France‚Äôs TotalEnergies and U.S. giant Chevron. Myanmar‚Äôs oil and gas revenues flow through a state-owned enterprise (SOE), the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which is estimated to collect over USD 1.5 billion in oil and gas revenues this year, which is about 50% of the foreign exchange available to the junta. This means the junta‚Äôs brutal operations are bankrolled by oil and gas revenues generated by international companies such as TotalEnergies, Chevron, and POSCO who risk complicity in these crimes. ¬† John","unwound_url":"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/governments-of-the-united-states-and-france-stop-blocking-sanctions-on-myanmar-gas-revenues?source=direct_link&"},{"start":182,"end":205,"url":"https://t.co/4v2oKvtqPD","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/bloodmoney22222/status/1476538431488462851/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/4v2oKvtqPD","images":{},"media_key":"3_1476538422122536960"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":[{"start":0,"end":9,"tag":"Petition"},{"start":168,"end":181,"tag":"SanctionMOGE"}]},"referenced_tweets":{},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":215,"reply_count":10,"like_count":189,"quote_count":39},"id":"1476538431488462851","author_id":"1412258592095416320","text":"#Petition\nùêÜùê®ùêØùêûùê´ùêßùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠ùê¨ ùê®ùêü ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêîùêßùê¢ùê≠ùêûùêù ùêíùê≠ùêöùê≠ùêûùê¨ ùêöùêßùêù ùêÖùê´ùêöùêßùêúùêû - ùêíùêìùêéùêè ùêõùê•ùê®ùêúùê§ùê¢ùêßùê†! ùêñùêû ùê∞ùêöùêßùê≠ ùê¨ùêöùêßùêúùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêßùê¨ ùê®ùêß ùêåùê≤ùêöùêßùê¶ùêöùê´'ùê¨ ùê®ùê¢ùê• ùêöùêßùêù ùê†ùêöùê¨ ùê´ùêûùêØùêûùêßùêÆùêûùê¨!\nSign this petition https://t.co/fikcHlrb47\n\n#SanctionMOGE https://t.co/4v2oKvtqPD","source":"Twitter for Android","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476538422122536960"]},"geo":{}},{"lang":"en","created_at":"2021-12-30T12:04:59.000Z","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1476524715309101056","entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":[{"start":168,"end":191,"url":"https://t.co/1KWl21kPbI","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/NRO/status/1476524238240727045","display_url":"twitter.com/NRO/status/147‚Ä¶"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"quoted","id":"1476524238240727045"}],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":24,"reply_count":8,"like_count":86,"quote_count":2},"id":"1476524715309101056","author_id":"15075999","text":"Plus 100.
