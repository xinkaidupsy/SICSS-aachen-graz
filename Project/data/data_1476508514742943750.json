The illness is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which is a new coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. Certain animals can be infected by the COVID-19 virus, but it appears to be an infrequent occurrence. If you contract COVID-19, you will need to remain quarantined on your property which may make caring for dogs a bit more challenging. If you suspect that you may have COVID-19 (with or without a positive test result), you should minimize contact with your pets. Just as you would quarantine yourself from the other human members of your home while sick, you should also quarantine yourself from your pets. If you are hospitalized and your pets must be cared for by a boarding kennel or pet sitter, inform the kennel or pet sitter that you are ill, allowing them to take the necessary precautions.","unwound_url":"https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/caring-for-your-pets-if-you-have-covid-19"}],"cashtags":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476509462945050626","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"48415682","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-30T11:04:22.000Z","conversation_id":"1476509462760460290","lang":"en","text":"235 new cases in Nepal \n\n[12:04 GMT] #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdate #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":37,"end":49,"tag":"coronavirus"},{"start":50,"end":68,"tag":"CoronaVirusUpdate"},{"start":69,"end":77,"tag":"COVID19"},{"start":78,"end":98,"tag":"CoronavirusPandemic"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":{},"urls":{},"cashtags":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"source":"COVID19-Updates","id":"1476509462760460290","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"1236273574895329281","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-30T11:04:22.000Z","conversation_id":"1476509461141405700","lang":"en","text":"@libe The solution has been identified to make the Covid-19 \"Green Pass\" irreplaceable and unconterfeitable, thus making the fight against the Covid-19 virus more effective\nhttps://t.co/EghcBsk251","entities":{"hashtags":{},"annotations":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":5,"username":"libe","id":"68440549"}],"urls":[{"start":173,"end":196,"url":"https://t.co/EghcBsk251","expanded_url":"http://visualgreenpass.com","display_url":"visualgreenpass.com","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1539865336916344832/JpkkTCOx?format=jpg&name=orig","width":640,"height":336},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1539865336916344832/JpkkTCOx?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"title":"Visual Green Pass | C.I.V.I.S.
