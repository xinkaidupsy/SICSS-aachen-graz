pandemic. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and vitamin D levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined. METHODS Consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. All patients underwent clinical evaluation and follow-up, laboratory measurements and a thoracic computerized tomography, including the measurement of epicardial fat thickness. Low vitamin D was defined as levels <20ng/mL (<50nmol/L) and deficient Vitamin D as a level ‚â§12ng/mL (<30nmol/L) RESULTS Of the 551 patients included, low vitamin D levels were present in 45.6% and deficient levels in 10.9%. Deficient Vitamin D levels were associated with mortality (HR 2.11, 95%CI 1.24-3.58, p=0.006) but not with critical COVID-19, adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and epicardial fat.

significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, there remains an unmet medical need for treatment options, which monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can potentially fill. This unmet need is exacerbated by the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that have shown some resistance to vaccine responses. Here we report the isolation of two highly potently neutralizing mAbs (THSC20.HVTR04 and THSC20.HVTR26) from an Indian convalescent donor, that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 VOCs at picomolar concentrations including the delta variant (B.1.617.2). These two mAbs target non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein thereby preventing the virus attachment to its host receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2).

Knowing which viruses are primed for zoonotic transmission can focus surveillance efforts and mitigation strategies for future pandemics. Successful engagement of receptor protein orthologs is necessary during cross-species transmission. The clade 1 sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter cells via engagement of ACE2, while the receptor for clade 2 and clade 3 remains largely uncharacterized. We developed a mixed cell pseudotyped virus infection assay to determine whether various clade 2 and 3 sarbecovirus spike proteins can enter HEK 293T cells expressing human or Rhinolophus horseshoe bat ACE2 proteins. The receptor binding domains from BtKY72 and Khosta-2 used human ACE2 for entry, while BtKY72 and Khosta-1 exhibited widespread use of diverse rhinolophid ACE2s. A lysine at ACE2 position 31 appeared to be a major determinant of the inability of these RBDs to use a cer","unwound_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.25.474149v1"},{"start":140,"end":163,"url":"https://t.co/RnurTL3DyM","expanded_url":"https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/","display_url":"outbreaksci.prereview.org","images":{},"status":200,"title":"PREreview","unwound_url":"https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/"}],"hashtags":[{"start":164,"end":176,"tag":"coronavirus"},{"start":177,"end":185,"tag":"COVID19"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T13:03:17.000Z","lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"conversation_id":"1476539388859498496","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"4901919879","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"id":"1476539386900611072","text":"#SouthAustralia: Just a reminder, the 1374 new #Corona cases reported today were 78 more than the ENTIRE number of cases in the state in the last 22 months from 19/02/2020 up until 19/12/2021. \n\nIn the last 11 days, 7700 new cases have been reported.\nü§¨\n\nhttps://t.co/TBIDz0LBuv","entities":{"urls":[{"start":254,"end":277,"url":"https://t.co/TBIDz0LBuv","expanded_url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-12-30/sa-records-1374-new-covid-cases/100730992","display_url":"abc.net.au/news/2021-12-3‚Ä¶","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1488545659061878788/5P6BFFh9?format=jpg&name=orig","width":862,"height":485},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1488545659061878788/5P6BFFh9?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"COVID-positive baby dies in South Australia, state records 1,374 new cases","description":"SA further relaxes testing requirements as the state's Premier says two-thirds of COVID-19 tests were¬†conducted on people without symptoms.","unwound_url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-12-30/sa-records-1374-new-covid-cases/100730992"}],"hashtags":[{"start":0,"end":15,"tag":"SouthAustralia"},{"start":47,"end":54,"tag":"Corona"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T13:03:17.000Z","lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":28,"reply_count":6,"like_count":135,"quote_count":2},"conversation_id":"1476539386900611072","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"2902636475","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"id":"1476539385877303299","text":"‚ÄúI think perhaps I should just add the obvious constitutional point here, which is that we are one country and people are more than free to move around inside our country under the general law, obviously.‚Äù\n\nHave Canadian governments heard about this idea?\nhttps://t.co/igLHLqdCiN","entities":{"urls":[{"start":256,"end":279,"url":"https://t.co/igLHLqdCiN","expanded_url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/scots-urged-not-evade-covid-rules-celebrating-new-year-england","display_url":"zerohedge.com/covid-19/scots‚Ä¶","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/scots-urged-not-evade-covid-rules-celebrating-new-year-england"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{},"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T13:03:17.000Z","lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":1,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"conversation_id":"1476539385877303299","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"227733054","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"WordPress.com","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"id":"1476539374049370114","text":"US coronavirus: Omicron surge is ‚Äòunlike anything we‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äô expert¬†says https://t.co/MzTbpRAgJu","entities":{"urls":[{"start":80,"end":103,"url":"https://t.co/MzTbpRAgJu","expanded_url":"https://currenttime.news/us-coronavirus-omicron-surge-is-unlike-anything-weve-ever-seen-expert-says/","display_url":"currenttime.news/us-coronavirus‚Ä¶","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1516996188813369344/dSj8-Pa_?format=png&name=orig","width":960,"height":541},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1516996188813369344/dSj8-Pa_?format=png&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Home -
