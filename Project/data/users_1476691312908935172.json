The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"}],"hashtags":{},"mentions":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T21:24:17.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":92,"reply_count":7,"like_count":261,"quote_count":4},"id":"1476665470220709897","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"author_id":"940876562","text":"206 Marines discharged for refusing COVID-19 vaccine","lang":"en","source":"Twitter for Android","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"conversation_id":"1476678804051484672","entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"mentions":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T22:17:16.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":41,"reply_count":22,"like_count":188,"quote_count":4},"id":"1476678804051484672","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"author_id":"27493883","text":"Irresponsible, UNVACCINATED people who contract Covid-19 are overwhelming hospitals, leading to the NEEDLESS DEATHS of people from non-Covid related causes.\n\nWho thinks hospitals should give priority to responsible, VACCINATED patients? ‚úã","lang":"en","source":"Twitter for iPhone","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"conversation_id":"1476546390423703554","entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"mentions":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T13:31:07.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":685,"reply_count":279,"like_count":3237,"quote_count":92},"id":"1476546390423703554","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"author_id":"119048111","text":"DOD announces at FEMA request \"approximately 65 military medical personnel will deploy in four new teams ‚Äì three 15-person teams to Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and one 20-person team to Pennsylvania ‚Äì to support civilian healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients.\"","lang":"en","source":"Twitter Web App","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"conversation_id":"1476585346699870215","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":0,"end":2,"probability":0.8693,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"DOD"},{"start":17,"end":20,"probability":0.897,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"FEMA"},{"start":132,"end":138,"probability":0.9934,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Arizona"},{"start":141,"end":148,"probability":0.8639,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Michigan"},{"start":155,"end":166,"probability":0.9915,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Pennsylvania"},{"start":195,"end":206,"probability":0.9646,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Pennsylvania"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"mentions":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T16:05:54.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":35,"reply_count":7,"like_count":97,"quote_count":1},"id":"1476585346699870215","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"author_id":"755135678422327296","text":"I have no interest in what you choose for yourself.
