Data sources: We searched bibliographic databases up to April 25, 2021. Two review authors sifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and additionally in trial sequential analyses for mortality. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials involving 3406 participants met review inclusion. Therapeutic Advances: Meta-analysis of 15 trials found that ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.19‚Äì0.73; n = 2438; I2 = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence). This result was confirmed in a trial sequential analysis using the same DerSimonian‚ÄìLaird method that underpinned the unadjusted analysis. This was also robust against a trial sequential analysis using the Biggerstaff‚ÄìTweedie method.

Currently, many studies have investigated the biocompatibility and toxicity of GFNs in vivo and in intro. Generally, GFNs may exert different degrees of toxicity in animals or cell models by following with different administration routes and penetrating through physiological barriers, subsequently being distributed in tissues or located in cells, eventually being excreted out of the bodies. This review collects studies on the toxic effects of GFNs in several organs and cell models. We also point out that various factors determine the toxicity of GFNs including the lateral size, surface structure, functionalization, charge, impurities, aggregations, and corona effect ect. In addition, several typical mechanisms underlying GFN toxicity have been revealed, for instance, physical destruction, oxidative stress, DNA damage, inflammatory r","unwound_url":"https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-016-0168-y"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":13,"username":"PirrohasFans","id":"1247565586273464320"},{"start":14,"end":25,"username":"disclosetv","id":"15392486"}],"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1476628931663085572","lang":"en","text":"@PirrohasFans @disclosetv Graphene oxide in covid19 vaccines and irreversible side effects: https://t.co/6fMVErHzcf","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476661019669897222","possibly_sensitive":true,"author_id":"2851914805","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476652682848919560"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"1247565586273464320","geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-30T21:06:34.000Z","entities":{"urls":{},"annotations":[{"start":135,"end":140,"probability":0.9941,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Sweden"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1476656169246724105","lang":"en","text":"I bet your thinking, why are you saying all this...because Covid-19 will bring it all around...saw a report on here, I think it was in Sweden that is starting to do this, it will show if you've had all your vaccination shots","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476661008752128009","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"3383592825","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476659421174538243"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"3383592825","geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-30T21:06:33.000Z","entities":{"urls":[{"start":239,"end":262,"url":"https://t.co/OCLylXmaum","expanded_url":"https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-flawed-study-fuels-erroneous-claims-about-covid-19-death-toll/","display_url":"factcheck.org/2021/04/sciche‚Ä¶","status":200,"title":"Flawed Report Fuels Erroneous Claims About COVID-19 Death Toll - FactCheck.org","description":"Viral social media posts cite a flawed paper in falsely claiming the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed death certificate procedures and violated federal law, resulting in wildly inflated COVID-19 deaths.
