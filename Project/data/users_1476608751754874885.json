The most common of more than 200 reported symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, pain, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Many people with the post COVID-19 condition have difficulty returning to baseline levels of function and have high rates of health care utilization. A conservative estimate suggests that 57,000 to 78,000 Ontarians have or are currently experiencing the post COVID-19 condition, although prevalence estimates can vary widely depending on the case-definition applied. Vaccination is likely protective against development of the post COVID-19 condition.
