COVID-19 has exacerbated an affordable housing crisis that predated the pandemic and that has deep disparities that threaten the strength of an economic recovery that must work for everyone. To meet this need, the Emergency Rental Assistance program makes funding available to assist households that are unable to pay rent or utilities. Two separate programs have been established: ERA1 provides up to $25 billion under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was enacted on December 27, 2020, and ERA2 provides up to $21.55 billion under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was enacted on March 11, 2021.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in work and social behavior may have reduced women’s use of such footwear. Methods This study assessed the trend in high-heel related injuries among U.S. women, using 2016-2020 data from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). Results In 2020 there were an estimated 6,290 high-heel related emergency department visits involving women ages 15-69, down from 16,000 per year in 2016-2019. The 2020 decline began after the start of the COVID-19 shutdowns on March 15. There was no significant change in the percentage of fractures or hospital admissions. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decline in reported injuries related to high-heeled shoes among US women. If this resulted from fewer women wearing such shoes, and such habits influence future behavior, the result may be fewer injuries in the future. ### ","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268426v1"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":127,"end":128,"probability":0.7565,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"US"}]},"possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","text":"Study of the Day: “The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decline in reported injuries related to high-heeled shoes among US women.” https://t.co/R2aUKjKokQ","id":"1476610479925563394","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476610478386393095"}],"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476610472896040963","author_id":"234363648","created_at":"2021-12-30T17:45:47.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":3,"reply_count":5,"like_count":17,"quote_count":1},"entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":126,"end":137,"probability":0.9735,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"South Africa"},{"start":147,"end":148,"probability":0.9864,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"UK"}]},"possibly_sensitive":false,"in_reply_to_user_id":"234363648","source":"Twitter Web App","text":"I don't post this as a doomsday notice, but because prominent data scientists who did not closely follow the rise and fall in South Africa and the UK are going to be stunned by the sheer transmissibility of omicron COVID-19.
