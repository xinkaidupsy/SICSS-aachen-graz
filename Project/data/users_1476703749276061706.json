Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021.

The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"}]},"conversation_id":"1476665470220709897","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":92,"reply_count":7,"like_count":261,"quote_count":4},"text":"Here it is the magic bullet!\nThe Omicron cold is being defeated by cross reactive T-cell immunity not vaccines, as witnessed in South Africa.\nCovid19 is dead, long live natural immunity! \nhttps://t.co/xysM7wAk94","possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","author_id":"50414265","created_at":"2021-12-30T20:02:57.000Z","id":"1476645000721149962","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":22,"end":36,"probability":0.9762,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Gary Brightwell"},{"start":44,"end":53,"probability":0.7858,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Matt Peart"},{"start":80,"end":93,"probability":0.9599,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Darius Slayton"},{"start":101,"end":116,"probability":0.5736,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Korey Cunningham"}],"hashtags":[{"start":4,"end":11,"tag":"Giants"}],"mentions":{},"urls":{}},"conversation_id":"1476645000721149962","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":7,"reply_count":12,"like_count":102,"quote_count":3},"text":"The #Giants placed RB Gary Brightwell and T Matt Peart on injured reserve. \n\nWR Darius Slayton and T Korey Cunningham to the Reserve/COVID-19 list.","possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","author_id":"3702400223","created_at":"2021-12-30T13:52:39.000Z","id":"1476551810936721413","entities":{"annotations":{},"hashtags":[{"start":58,"end":66,"tag":"COVID19"},{"start":181,"end":189,"tag":"Omicron"}],"mentions":{},"urls":{}},"conversation_id":"1476551810936721413","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1975,"reply_count":107,"like_count":5497,"quote_count":209},"text":"1.
