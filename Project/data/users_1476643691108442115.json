It allows for natural inoculation. #Acutes Quercetin 500 mg twice a day of quercetin is good starting dose for most adults. If heavy (>200 lb) or severely ill, e.g. short of breath, start at 1 g twice a day. The key is double the dose every day symptoms persist, up to 3 g twice a day. As advised by @dwmoskowitz An important note: no food, herb can contain enough #Quercetin in therapeutic dosage to help against #COVID19, the minimum required amount for prevention per day is 500mg, no choice but to supplement, average diets will never reach such high amounts.For prevention","unwound_url":"https://www.change.org/p/united-nations-petition-governments-to-support-antiviral-protocols-against-covid-19/u/29297448"},{"start":596,"end":619,"url":"https://t.co/vI1MEDF2xE","expanded_url":"http://thenabsters.blogspot.com/2020/12/15th-entry-extra-covid19-anti-viral.html","display_url":"thenabsters.blogspot.com/2020/12/15th-e‚Ä¶","images":{},"status":200,"title":"15th Entry - Extra - COVID19 Anti-Viral Protocol Dosage...","description":"¬† Dr. Zev Zelenko @zev_dr https://www.facebook.com/covid19win/ https://www.vladimirzelenkomd.com This from Dr Zev Zelenko who successfully t...","unwound_url":"http://thenabsters.blogspot.com/2020/12/15th-entry-extra-covid19-anti-viral.html"},{"start":620,"end":643,"url":"https://t.co/fJrJ94KySj","expanded_url":"http://thenabsters.blogspot.com/2021/02/23rd-entry-revisiting-quercetin-as.html","display_url":"thenabsters.blogspot.com/2021/02/23rd-e‚Ä¶","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1549352920587681793/NAmvnoIk?format=jpg&name=orig","width":900,"height":507},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1549352920587681793/NAmvnoIk?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"23rd Entry - Revisiting Quercetin as antidote to allergic response provoked by SARSCoV2 protein spike.","description":"Revisiting Quercetin as antidote to allergic response provoked by SARSCoV2 protein.

The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":50,"reply_count":457,"like_count":57,"quote_count":5},"id":"1475793662852222978","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","created_at":"2021-12-28T11:40:02.000Z","conversation_id":"1475793662852222978","author_id":"81415307","text":"#DidYouKnow at least 6‚É£5‚É£0‚É£ million girlsüëßüèæ and women alive today were married in childhood?\n\nChild marriage is a human rights violation, affecting girls and women in every region of the worldüåç. #EndChildMarriage #ForEveryChild #Uganda #InvestInUGchildren https://t.co/YvS5zVHOIV","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1475792011978592256"],"poll_ids":{}},"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":0,"end":11,"tag":"DidYouKnow"},{"start":195,"end":212,"tag":"EndChildMarriage"},{"start":213,"end":227,"tag":"ForEveryChild"},{"start":228,"end":235,"tag":"Uganda"},{"start":236,"end":255,"tag":"InvestInUGchildren"}],"urls":[{"start":256,"end":279,"url":"https://t.co/YvS5zVHOIV","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/UNICEFUganda/status/1475793662852222978/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/YvS5zVHOIV","media_key":"3_1475792011978592256"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":33,"reply_count":50,"like_count":178,"quote_count":10},"id":"1476635757569732609","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"TweetDeck","created_at":"2021-12-30T19:26:13.000Z","conversation_id":"1476635757569732609","author_id":"1080586433088258048","text":"THIS JUST IN: The Index of State Economic Momentum ranks states based on recent performance in 3 measures of economic vitality: personal income growth, employment growth, &amp; population growth. \n\nIn the final update of 2021, Nevada claimed the top spot.","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"entities":{"hashtags":{},"urls":{},"annotations":[{"start":223,"end":228,"probability":0.8537,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Nevada"}],"mentions":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1625,"reply_count":782,"like_count":12701,"quote_count":132},"id":"1476611502056505345","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter for iPhone","created_at":"2021-12-30T17:49:50.000Z","conversation_id":"1476611502056505345","author_id":"1543986138","text":"This US debate about needing vaccination to fly seems to ignore fact that no vaccination-no fly has been policy in Canada for months.
