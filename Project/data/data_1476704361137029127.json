In this report, we demonstrate that the block of HIV-1 replication by GPS491 is accompanied by a drastic inhibition of viral gene expression (IC50 ~ 0.25 ¬µM), and alterations in the production of unspliced, singly spliced, and multiply spliced HIV-1 RNAs. GPS491 also inhibited the replication of adenovirus and multiple coronaviruses. Low ¬µM doses of GPS491 reduced adenovirus infectious yield ~1000 fold, altered virus early gene expression/viral E1A RNA processing, blocked viral DNA amplification, and inhibited late (hexon) gene expression. Loss of replication of multiple coronaviruses (229E, OC43, SARS-CoV2) upon GPS491 addition was associated with the inhibition of viral structural protein expression and the ","unwound_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/1/60"},{"start":243,"end":266,"url":"https://t.co/EpJhjCod7i","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/DahalSubha/status/1476704560928468992/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/EpJhjCod7i","images":{},"media_key":"3_1476704544931336201"}],"hashtags":[{"start":213,"end":225,"tag":"mdpiviruses"}],"mentions":[{"start":230,"end":242,"username":"VirusesMDPI","id":"2890854922"}],"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476704560928468992","author_id":"2913329390","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"Thrilled to share my First author paper on MDPI Viruses. \"The Thiazole-5-Carboxamide GPS491 Inhibits HIV-1, Adenovirus, and Coronavirus Replication by Altering RNA Processing/Accumulation\" https://t.co/sPESeGoSWA #mdpiviruses via @VirusesMDPI https://t.co/EpJhjCod7i","created_at":"2021-12-30T23:59:37.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":4,"reply_count":2,"like_count":9,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476704560911687686","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"entities":{"annotations":[{"start":34,"end":46,"probability":0.6851,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"United States"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":18,"username":"spectatorindex","id":"1626294277"}],"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476704560911687686","author_id":"1392828969783898113","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"RT @spectatorindex: BREAKING: The United States reports over half a million new daily coronavirus cases, the most of any country since the‚Ä¶","created_at":"2021-12-30T23:59:37.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2005,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1476681634246135809"}],"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476704559758295042","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"entities":{"annotations":[{"start":18,"end":20,"probability":0.8139,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"CDC"}],"urls":[{"start":98,"end":121,"url":"https://t.co/UYfZciKWwg","expanded_url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/12/30/cdc-cruise-warning-avoid-omicron/?tid=ss_tw","display_url":"washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/12‚Ä¶","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/12/30/cdc-cruise-warning-avoid-omicron/?tid=ss_tw"}],"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":16,"username":"Limbictweets","id":"105433445"}],"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476704559758295042","author_id":"2764949307","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"RT @Limbictweets: CDC warns against cruise travel after 5,000 new coronavirus cases in 2 weeks    https://t.co/UYfZciKWwg","created_at":"2021-12-30T23:59:37.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":6,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1476677455721033738"}],"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476704558978117634","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":11,"username":"cyprianous","id":"221519905"},{"start":12,"end":25,"username":"ActivistPost","id":"154532994"}],"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476702755582771207","author_id":"1339757096485744642","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"@cyprianous @ActivistPost Reimbursement!\n\nwhat a low down snake.\n\nCOVID19, Inc.","created_at":"2021-12-30T23:59:37.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476702755582771207"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"221519905","geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","id":"1476704558952943624","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":17,"username":"lizziedearden","id":"253536139"}],"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476704558952943624","author_id":"1278335004779712512","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"RT @lizziedearden: A CPS review has found that a third of the coronavirus prosecutions checked (773 out of 2,573) have so far been wrongful‚Ä¶","created_at":"2021-12-30T23:59:37.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":112,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1476500058594058242"}],"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476704558747324431","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":[{"start":47,"end":65,"tag":"corsirosenthalbox"}],"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":13,"username":"PNSlipper","id":"459858173"},{"start":22,"end":37,"username":"TheArtOfCharts","id":"4711377318"}],"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476704558747324431","author_id":"2676056357","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"RT @PNSlipper: Thanks @TheArtOfCharts.
