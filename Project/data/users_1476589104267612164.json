Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular, we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively, in the first month after primary vaccination. However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6%, 95% CI: 30.4 to 70.4%). ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have decl","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v2"},{"start":285,"end":308,"url":"https://t.co/3Oh3IJSVIk","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/ezralevant/status/1474106318206255113/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/3Oh3IJSVIk","images":{},"media_key":"3_1474105645309829123"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":82,"end":87,"probability":0.6084,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"Pfizer"},{"start":91,"end":97,"probability":0.4622,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"Moderna"},{"start":107,"end":113,"probability":0.5717,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"Omicron"}]},"lang":"en","source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1474106318206255113","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":14922,"reply_count":1888,"like_count":28278,"quote_count":2559},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1474105645309829123"],"poll_ids":{}},"text":"Holy moly.\n\nThis study shows that after three months the vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer &amp; Moderna against Omicron is actually negative.
