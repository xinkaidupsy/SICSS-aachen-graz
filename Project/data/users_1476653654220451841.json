The objective of this quasi-experimental study was to determine whether bolus vitamin D supplementation taken either regularly over the preceding year or after the diagnosis of COVID-19 was effective in improving survival among hospitalized frail elderly COVID-19 patients. Methods. Seventy-seven patients consecutively hospitalized for COVID-19 in a geriatric unit were included. Intervention groups were participants regularly supplemented with vitamin D over the preceding year (Group 1), and those supplemented with vitamin D after COVID-19 diagnosis (Group 2). The comparator group involved participants having received no vitamin D supplements (Group 3). Outcomes were 14-day mortality and highest (worst) score on the ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI) measured during COVID-19 acute phase. Potential confounders were age, gender, functional abilities, undernutrition, cancer, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, glycated hemoglobin, number of acute health issues at admission","unwound_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/11/3377"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":12,"username":"CofffeeLife","id":"68905430"},{"start":13,"end":22,"username":"KCYatsko","id":"2195449525"},{"start":23,"end":37,"username":"TheRealRhllor","id":"3178344798"}],"hashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1476510859170099203","lang":"en","text":"@CofffeeLife @KCYatsko @TheRealRhllor Vitamin D Supplementation Associated to Better Survival in Hospitalized Frail Elderly COVID-19 Patients: The GERIA-COVID Quasi-Experimental Study\n\nhttps://t.co/L9t4PMcZ1V","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476653991970938884","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"1403015669285785605","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476583275527380996"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"68905430","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-28T18:01:00.000Z","entities":{"urls":[{"start":264,"end":287,"url":"https://t.co/ZsCyzEBMTC","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/elena_rinne/status/1475289009979015170","display_url":"twitter.com/elena_rinne/st‚Ä¶"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":{},"hashtags":{}},"conversation_id":"1475889536785862656","lang":"en","text":"So, this tweet got a lot of unexpected attention in the last 24 hours.
