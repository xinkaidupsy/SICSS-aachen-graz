crRNA improves CRISPR–Cas12a specificity in the N501Y mutation detection of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Mu variants of SARS-CoV-2","description":"Many CRISPR/Cas platforms have been established for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. But the detection platform of the variants of SARS-CoV-2 is scarce because its specificity is very challenging to achieve for those with only one or a few nucleotide(s) differences. Here, we report for the first time that chimeric crRNA could be critical in enhancing the specificity of CRISPR-Cas12a detecting of N501Y, which is shared by Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Mu variants of SARS-CoV-2 without compromising its sensitivity. This strategy could also be applied to detect other SARS-CoV-2 variants that differ only one or a few nucleotide(s) differences.","unwound_url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0261778"}],"hashtags":[{"start":159,"end":167,"tag":"covid19"}],"annotations":{},"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","text":"Chimeric crRNA improves CRISPR-Cas12a specificity in the N501Y mutation detection of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Mu variants of SARS-Co... https://t.co/RNOEBIvk2s #covid19","referenced_tweets":{},"possibly_sensitive":false,"created_at":"2021-12-30T15:57:57.000Z","conversation_id":"1476583345559465984","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for Android","author_id":"1266075992256282624","id":"1476583345387675652","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2,"reply_count":1,"like_count":13,"quote_count":0},"entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":[{"start":280,"end":303,"url":"https://t.co/gDsM9rDW4b","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/AvrahamCooperMD/status/1476357482767343618","display_url":"twitter.com/AvrahamCooperM…"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{},"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","text":"CoViD19 taught us the dimensions of ARDS that we didn't know before and the indication of vvECMO has expanded but sometimes even the greatest efforts remain without success in a battle against this terrible disease\nWhere therapeutic possibilities r limited PREVENTION is the key💉 https://t.co/gDsM9rDW4b","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"quoted","id":"1476357482767343618"}],"possibly_sensitive":false,"created_at":"2021-12-30T15:57:57.000Z","conversation_id":"1476583345387675652","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPad","author_id":"1362177019","id":"1476583342090985476","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":[{"start":114,"end":137,"url":"https://t.co/jPalcsSUvo","expanded_url":"https://apple.news/A3MIBDPGhQ8m9qhKDac6gjg","display_url":"apple.news/A3MIBDPGhQ8m9q…","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://apple.news/A3MIBDPGhQ8m9qhKDac6gjg"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":77,"end":88,"probability":0.8571,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"South Africa"},{"start":98,"end":108,"probability":0.8092,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"MarketWatch"}],"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","text":"J&amp;J's COVID-19 vaccine booster was 85% effective against hospitalization, in South Africa study - MarketWatch https://t.co/jPalcsSUvo","referenced_tweets":{},"possibly_sensitive":false,"created_at":"2021-12-30T15:57:57.000Z","conversation_id":"1476583342090985476","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","author_id":"432151360","id":"1476583334914539527","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":8,"reply_count":1,"like_count":11,"quote_count":1},"entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":[{"start":229,"end":252,"url":"https://t.co/tF6phOfVzT","expanded_url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/os-ne-coronavirus-fdoh-demings-omicron-20211230-zh4mpc74xzacbljz5khyqchqzy-story.html","display_url":"orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/os…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1494715631928680449/lw3E15Pw?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1200,"height":961},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1494715631928680449/lw3E15Pw?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Florida doesn’t plan to open COVID testing sites amid surge, Orange County official says","description":"A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health said Tuesday that it has no outstanding requests for COVID resources from Orange County.
