(COVID-19) pandemic has led to global research to predict those who are at greatest risk of developing severe disease and mortality. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the associations between obesity and the severity of and mortality due to COVID-19. Methods We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases for studies evaluating the associations of obesity with COVID-19. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random- or fixed-effects models. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to estimate regression coefficients. Results Forty-six studies involving 625,153 patients were included. Compared with nonobese patients, obese patients had a significantly increased risk of infection. (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.53–4.87; I2 = 96.8%), hospitalization (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.55–1.92; I2 = 47.4%), clinically severe disease (OR 3.81, 95% CI 1.97–7.35; I2 = 57.4%), mechanical ventilation (OR 1.","unwound_url":"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11546-6"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":11,"username":"lucatelese","id":"100610543"}],"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"author_id":"1415301154767097858","conversation_id":"1476446420186062849","created_at":"2021-12-30T10:51:12.000Z","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476506149696544770","text":"@lucatelese Patients with obesity may have a greater risk of infection, hospitalization, clinically severe disease, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and mortality.
