Currently, many studies have investigated the biocompatibility and toxicity of GFNs in vivo and in intro. Generally, GFNs may exert different degrees of toxicity in animals or cell models by following with different administration routes and penetrating through physiological barriers, subsequently being distributed in tissues or located in cells, eventually being excreted out of the bodies. This review collects studies on the toxic effects of GFNs in several organs and cell models. We also point out that various factors determine the toxicity of GFNs including the lateral size, surface structure, functionalization, charge, impurities, aggregations, and corona effect ect. In addition, several typical mechanisms underlying GFN toxicity have been revealed, for instance, physical destruction, oxidative stress, DNA damage, inflammatory r","unwound_url":"https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-016-0168-y"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":7,"username":"rldaug","id":"862418661067436033"},{"start":8,"end":24,"username":"RepLloydDoggett","id":"153944899"}],"cashtags":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"in_reply_to_user_id":"862418661067436033","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476652907739164675"}],"geo":{}},{"author_id":"882827833894207489","text":"for past 3 days,2x every day-&gt;Mumbai reports 3,671 cases  https://t.co/skQc1NJJbz","lang":"en","source":"Twitter Web App","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1476662325708931074","created_at":"2021-12-30T21:11:48.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"id":"1476662325708931074","entities":{"urls":[{"start":61,"end":84,"url":"https://t.co/skQc1NJJbz","expanded_url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/covid-19-with-rising-cases-section-144-imposed-in-mumbai-till-january-7/article38069024.ece","display_url":"thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/…","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/covid-19-with-rising-cases-section-144-imposed-in-mumbai-till-january-7/article38069024.ece"}],"annotations":[{"start":30,"end":35,"probability":0.8723,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Mumbai"}],"hashtags":{},"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"author_id":"76417139","text":"In ambulatory patients (&gt;/= 18 years) with mild to moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who have no other treatment options, the IDSA guideline panel suggests #molnupiravir initiated within 5 days of symptom onset rather than no molnupiravir.","lang":"en","source":"Twitter Web App","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1476662322777182220","created_at":"2021-12-30T21:11:48.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":4,"reply_count":1,"like_count":15,"quote_count":1},"id":"1476662325268697093","entities":{"urls":{},"annotations":{},"hashtags":[{"start":190,"end":203,"tag":"molnupiravir"}],"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"in_reply_to_user_id":"76417139","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476662322777182220"}],"geo":{}},{"author_id":"76417139","text":"Update Alert: IDSA has released a new recommendation on the use of molnupiravir to Treatment and Management of COVID-19 Guideline (https://t.co/VpearLkGhG).\n\nSee below 👇","lang":"en","source":"Twitter Web App","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1476662322777182220","created_at":"2021-12-30T21:11:47.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":28,"reply_count":2,"like_count":56,"quote_count":1},"id":"1476662322777182220","entities":{"urls":[{"start":131,"end":154,"url":"https://t.co/VpearLkGhG","expanded_url":"https://bit.ly/3pGqTMH","display_url":"bit.ly/3pGqTMH","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1550725355819999234/9cCxmJcO?format=png&name=orig","width":800,"height":800},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1550725355819999234/9cCxmJcO?format=png&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"COVID-19 Guideline, Part 1: Treatment and Management","description":"IDSA has developed living, frequently updated evidence-based guidelines to support patients, clinicians and other health-care professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 infection.
