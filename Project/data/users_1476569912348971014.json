However, asymptomatic infections have increased the challenges of providing accurate estimates for the infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19.Methods: We calculated the asymptomatic case ratios based on the reported COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong where intensive testing has been conducted in close contacts and high-risk populations. We estimated the IFR using both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as denominator. The boosted regression tree (BRT) and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify relative contribution and effect size of the risk factors associated with the asymptomatic cases and IFRs.Results: The ratio of the asymptomatic patients in Hong Kong was higher than many other regions over the world. Imported cases had a higher asymptomatic proportion than local cases.
