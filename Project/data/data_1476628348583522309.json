Elisabeth Mahase looks at the evidence behind the different strategies In the US, new rules mean that people have to isolate for only five days, while in the UK they have to isolate for 10 days unless they have negative lateral flow tests on days 6 and 7, at which point they can stop isolating.12 In France and Japan the isolation period is 10 days, while in New Zealand it is 10 days if the person is fully vaccinated (including 72 hours free of symptoms) but 14 days if they are unvaccinated (again including 72 hours free of symptoms). Germany, Jordan, and Brazil are following the World Health Organization‚Äôs recommended 14 day isolation period.
