Omicron VOC Transmission in Danish Households","description":"The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) is a rapidly spreading variant of SARS-CoV-2 that is likely to overtake the previously dominant Delta VOC in many countries by the end of 2021. We estimated the transmission dynamics following the spread of Omicron VOC within Danish households during December 2021. We used data from Danish registers to estimate the household secondary attack rate (SAR). Among 11,937 households (2,225 with the Omicron VOC), we identified 6,397 secondary infections during a 1-7 day follow-up period. The SAR was 31% and 21% in households with the Omicron and Delta VOC, respectively. We found an increased transmission for unvaccinated individuals, and a reduced transmission for booster-vaccinated individuals, compared to fully vaccinated individuals. Comparing households infected with the Omicron to Delta VOC, we found an 1.17 (95%-CI: 0.99-1.38) times higher SAR for unvaccinated, 2.61 times (95%-CI: 2.34-2.90) higher for fully vaccinated and 3.66 (95%-CI: 2.65-5.05) ti","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.27.21268278v1"},{"start":219,"end":242,"url":"https://t.co/vXWQ01tVIz","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/LyngseF/status/1476223591138140167/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/vXWQ01tVIz","images":{},"media_key":"3_1476222729997139973"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":[{"start":125,"end":133,"tag":"Omicron"},{"start":137,"end":143,"tag":"Delta"}]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":392,"reply_count":38,"like_count":983,"quote_count":180},"possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"New Preprint Out!\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC Transmission in Danish Households\nWe investigate the secondary attack rate (SAR) in #Omicron vs #Delta households in Demark, 9th-19th December 2021. \nhttps://t.co/22qsDMJAGf\n1/N https://t.co/vXWQ01tVIz","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476222729997139973"]},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"author_id":"233737858","conversation_id":"1476282275331559429","created_at":"2021-12-29T20:01:37.000Z","lang":"en","source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476282275331559429","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":10,"end":18,"probability":0.9856,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Dr. Fauci"}],"urls":[{"start":240,"end":263,"url":"https://t.co/gaSqioiv5W","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1476255696807243789","display_url":"twitter.com/thehill/status‚Ä¶"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":354,"reply_count":661,"like_count":1191,"quote_count":57},"possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"It‚Äôs nice Dr. Fauci is finally recognizing the danger of his ill advised shutdowns that didn‚Äôt work.
