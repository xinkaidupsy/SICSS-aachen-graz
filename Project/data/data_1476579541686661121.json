Here, we present evidence that antibodies induced by currently circulating influenza A H1N1 (flu) strains cross react with the most critical receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that interacts with the ACE2 receptor. About 58– 68% of blood donors in Stockholm had detectable antibodies to this cross-reactive peptide, NGVEGF, and seasonal flu vaccination trended to enhance binding of inhibitory antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. This peptide also activated CD8 T cells in 20% of healthy subjects. Eleven additional CD8 T-cell peptides that cross-react with flu and SARS-CoV-2 were identified that potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 in 40–71% of individuals, depending on their HLA type.
