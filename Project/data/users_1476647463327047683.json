If heavy (>200 lb) or severely ill, e.g. short of breath, start at 1 g twice a day. The key is double the dose every day symptoms persist, up to 3 g twice a day. As advised by @dwmoskowitz An important note: no food, herb can contain enough #Quercetin in therapeutic dosage to help against #COVID19, the minimum required amount for prevention per day is 500mg, no choice but to supplement, average diets will never reach such high amounts.For prevention","unwound_url":"https://www.change.org/p/united-nations-petition-governments-to-support-antiviral-protocols-against-covid-19/u/29297448"},{"start":596,"end":619,"url":"https://t.co/vI1MEDF2xE","expanded_url":"http://thenabsters.blogspot.com/2020/12/15th-entry-extra-covid19-anti-viral.html","display_url":"thenabsters.blogspot.com/2020/12/15th-e‚Ä¶","images":{},"status":200,"title":"15th Entry - Extra - COVID19 Anti-Viral Protocol Dosage...","description":"¬† Dr. Zev Zelenko @zev_dr https://www.facebook.com/covid19win/ https://www.vladimirzelenkomd.com This from Dr Zev Zelenko who successfully t...","unwound_url":"http://thenabsters.blogspot.com/2020/12/15th-entry-extra-covid19-anti-viral.html"},{"start":620,"end":643,"url":"https://t.co/fJrJ94KySj","expanded_url":"http://thenabsters.blogspot.com/2021/02/23rd-entry-revisiting-quercetin-as.html","display_url":"thenabsters.blogspot.com/2021/02/23rd-e‚Ä¶","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1549352920587681793/NAmvnoIk?format=jpg&name=orig","width":900,"height":507},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1549352920587681793/NAmvnoIk?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"23rd Entry - Revisiting Quercetin as antidote to allergic response provoked by SARSCoV2 protein spike.","description":"Revisiting Quercetin as antidote to allergic response provoked by SARSCoV2 protein.
