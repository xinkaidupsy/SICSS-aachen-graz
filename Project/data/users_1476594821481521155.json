Methods This was a phase 2/3 open-label, multi-centre study done across six hospitals in India. All children received two 0.5mL doses of BBV152 (Covaxin¬Æ, Bharat Biotech International Ltd., Hyderabad, India), which is the same formulation indicated in adults. Participants were monitored for adverse events, and post-vaccination blood draws were collected to assess neutralising antibodies. A total of 526 children were enrolled into Group 1 (ages 12 through 18 years, n=176), Group 2 (ages 6 through 12 years, n=175), Group 3 (ages 2 through 6 years, n=175). Findings There were no serious adverse events, deaths, or withdrawals due to an adverse event during the study.
