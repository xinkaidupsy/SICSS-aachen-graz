However, the association between calcification and AD, the triggers for calcification, and its role within the disease are not clear. On the other hand, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (pTau) tangles have been widely studied and recognized as an essential factor in developing AD. In this work, calcification in the brains of AD patients is characterized by advanced electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Results are then compared to samples from cognitively healthy, age-matched donors, and the colocalization of calcification and pTau is investigated. Here, we show that AD patients’ brains present microcalcification associated with the neural cell nuclei and cell projections, and that these are strongly related to the presence of pTau.
