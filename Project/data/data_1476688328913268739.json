Purpose Estimate the IFR of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly populations and other age groups from seroprevalence studies. Study protocol: . Data Sources Seroprevalence studies done in 2020 and identified by any of four existing systematic reviews. Study Selection SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies with ‚â•1000 participants aged ‚â•70 years that presented seroprevalence in elderly people; aimed to generate samples reflecting the general population; and whose location had available data on cumulative COVID-19 deaths in elderly (primary cutoff ‚â•70 years; ‚â•65 or ‚â•60 also eligible).
