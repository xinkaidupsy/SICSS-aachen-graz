We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"}],"mentions":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":92,"reply_count":7,"like_count":261,"quote_count":4},"created_at":"2021-12-30T21:24:17.000Z","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476665470220709897","text":"Here it is the magic bullet!\nThe Omicron cold is being defeated by cross reactive T-cell immunity not vaccines, as witnessed in South Africa.\nCovid19 is dead, long live natural immunity! \nhttps://t.co/xysM7wAk94","id":"1476665470220709897","author_id":"1574782297","source":"Twitter for Android","possibly_sensitive":false,"referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"entities":{"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":37,"end":40,"probability":0.7482,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Fort"}],"urls":[{"start":245,"end":268,"url":"https://t.co/oAMJ5bxYbR","expanded_url":"https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/pediatric-covid-patients-at-cook-childrens-in-fort-worth-tripled/287-82a8051e-82fa-4a89-a081-a5400e36b69b","display_url":"wfaa.com/article/news/h‚Ä¶","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/pediatric-covid-patients-at-cook-childrens-in-fort-worth-tripled/287-82a8051e-82fa-4a89-a081-a5400e36b69b"}],"mentions":[{"start":19,"end":33,"username":"CookChildrens","id":"20990717"},{"start":237,"end":242,"username":"wfaa","id":"15694286"}]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":9,"reply_count":1,"like_count":23,"quote_count":4},"created_at":"2021-12-30T17:01:35.000Z","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476599358061752322","text":"Sobering data from @CookChildrens in Fort Worth. \n\nThe hospital is treating at least 29 kids with COVID-19. \n\n5 are in the ICU.
