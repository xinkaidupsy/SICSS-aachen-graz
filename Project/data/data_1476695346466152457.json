Amid growing concerns regarding an “infodemic”, ensuring the quality of information is a crucial vector of public health. Investigating if and how Wikipedia remained up to date and in line with science is key to formulating strategies to counter misinformation.

Results We found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media sources and high-quality academic research. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English COVID-19 articles from 2001-2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness.
