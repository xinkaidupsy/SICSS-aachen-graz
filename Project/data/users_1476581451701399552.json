covid-19 vaccine efficacy and safety in the post-authorisation phase","description":"When covid-19 vaccines were first authorised, regulators required post-authorisation studies to tackle important uncertainties about efficacy and safety. But these studies may have little practical value unless there is greater engagement and scrutiny from the wider scientific community, argue Christof Prugger and colleagues Expedited approval pathways have been increasingly used over the past 30 years to bring new medicines to market. The basic premise has been to give patients earlier access to medicines, often achieved by relying on less robust forms of evidence at the time of approval, such as showing efficacy against surrogate endpoints rather than patient outcomes.1 Expedited approvals are often coupled with requirements to conduct post-authorisation studies to confirm that the medicines safely provide the anticipated benefit.
