Sisonke study which had provided single dose Ad26.COV.2 vaccine to almost 500 000 health care workers (HCW) in South Africa to include a booster dose of the Ad26.COV.2. Sisonke 2 enrolled 227 310 HCW from the 8 November to the 17 December 2021. Enrolment commenced before the onset of the Omicron driven fourth wave in South Africa affording us an opportunity to evaluate early VE in preventing hospital admissions of a homologous boost of the Ad26.COV.2 vaccine given 6-9 months after the initial vaccination in HCW. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine booster in 69 092 HCW as compared to unvaccinated individuals enrolled in the same managed care organization using a test negative design. We compared VE against COVID19 admission for omicron during the period 15 November to 20 December 2021","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.28.21268436v1"}],"hashtags":{},"cashtags":[{"start":7,"end":11,"tag":"JNJ"}]},"possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1476315440578285571","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476521599230689283"}],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":2,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"id":"1476521602435239937","author_id":"3142088601","text":"linked $JNJ preprint\n\nVaccine effectiveness against hospital admission in South African health care workers who received a homologous booster of Ad26.COV2 during an Omicron COVID19 wave: Preliminary Results of the Sisonke 2 Study. https://t.co/igiBX1EVvE","source":"Twitter Web App","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"in_reply_to_user_id":"626470812","lang":"en","created_at":"2021-12-30T11:52:36.000Z","entities":{"annotations":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":9,"username":"Zubhaque","id":"626470812"}],"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1476261061183557634","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476262076431613956"}],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"id":"1476521601839550466","author_id":"20681638","text":"@Zubhaque What do vulnerable do / how have we always supported them prior to Covid19?
