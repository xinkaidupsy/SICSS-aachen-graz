In this report, we demonstrate that the block of HIV-1 replication by GPS491 is accompanied by a drastic inhibition of viral gene expression (IC50 ~ 0.25 µM), and alterations in the production of unspliced, singly spliced, and multiply spliced HIV-1 RNAs. GPS491 also inhibited the replication of adenovirus and multiple coronaviruses. Low µM doses of GPS491 reduced adenovirus infectious yield ~1000 fold, altered virus early gene expression/viral E1A RNA processing, blocked viral DNA amplification, and inhibited late (hexon) gene expression. Loss of replication of multiple coronaviruses (229E, OC43, SARS-CoV2) upon GPS491 addition was associated with the inhibition of viral structural protein expression and the ","unwound_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/1/60"},{"start":243,"end":266,"url":"https://t.co/EpJhjCod7i","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/DahalSubha/status/1476704560928468992/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/EpJhjCod7i","images":{},"media_key":"3_1476704544931336201"}],"mentions":[{"start":230,"end":242,"username":"VirusesMDPI","id":"2890854922"}]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":4,"reply_count":2,"like_count":9,"quote_count":0},"id":"1476704560928468992","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","created_at":"2021-12-30T23:59:37.000Z","conversation_id":"1476704560928468992","author_id":"2913329390","text":"Thrilled to share my First author paper on MDPI Viruses. \"The Thiazole-5-Carboxamide GPS491 Inhibits HIV-1, Adenovirus, and Coronavirus Replication by Altering RNA Processing/Accumulation\" https://t.co/sPESeGoSWA #mdpiviruses via @VirusesMDPI https://t.co/EpJhjCod7i","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476704544931336201"]},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"entities":{"annotations":{},"hashtags":{},"urls":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":11,"username":"cyprianous","id":"221519905"},{"start":12,"end":25,"username":"ActivistPost","id":"154532994"}]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"id":"1476704558978117634","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","created_at":"2021-12-30T23:59:37.000Z","conversation_id":"1476702755582771207","author_id":"1339757096485744642","text":"@cyprianous @ActivistPost Reimbursement!\n\nwhat a low down snake.\n\nCOVID19, Inc.","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476702755582771207"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"221519905","geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"entities":{"annotations":{},"hashtags":{},"urls":[{"start":69,"end":92,"url":"https://t.co/4FfY0UncqD","expanded_url":"https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/covid-19-portrait-quotidien-du-statut-vaccinal-des-nouveaux-cas-et-des-nouvelles-hospitalisations#","display_url":"donneesquebec.ca/recherche/data…","status":200,"title":"COVID-19 - Portrait quotidien du statut vaccinal des nouveaux cas et des nouvelles hospitalisations - Données Québec","description":"Note importante - Arrêt de la mise à jour.

Because COVID-19 can spread via respired droplets, most US states mandated mask use in public settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask efficacy against respiratory viruses, and observational studies conflict on whether mask use predicts lower infection rates. We hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use were associated with lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States.Methods: We calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance dates of neighboring states with mandates.Results: Earlier mask mandates were not associated with lower total cases or lower maximum growth rates.
