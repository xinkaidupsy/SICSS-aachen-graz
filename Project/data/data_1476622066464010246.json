This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 μm range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of <300 nm and >300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of differe","unwound_url":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252"},{"start":224,"end":247,"url":"https://t.co/FZHVCCaVvT","expanded_url":"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1435.short","display_url":"bmj.com/content/369/bm…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1549816630892445697/7RQuvbvT?format=jpg&name=orig","width":540,"height":350},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1549816630892445697/7RQuvbvT?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Face masks for the public during the covid-19 crisis","description":"Trisha Greenhalgh and colleagues argue that it is time to apply the precautionary principle The precautionary principle is, according to Wikipedia, “a strategy for approaching issues of potential harm when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking.” The evidence base on the efficacy and acceptability of the different types of face mask in preventing respiratory infections during epidemics is sparse and contested.12 But covid-19 is a serious illness that currently has no known treatment or vaccine and is spreading in an immune naive population. Deaths are rising steeply, and health systems are under strain. This raises an ethical question: should policy makers apply the precautionary principle now and encourage people to wear face masks on the grounds that we have little to lose and potentially something to gain from this measure?3 We believe they should.
