The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"},{"start":231,"end":254,"url":"https://t.co/Pb2uGsj3Go","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/virusmonologues/status/1476221647417921536?s=21","display_url":"twitter.com/virusmonologue‚Ä¶","images":{}},{"start":255,"end":278,"url":"https://t.co/zWUstVJ3xR","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/sailorrooscout/status/1476550590876557317/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/zWUstVJ3xR","images":{},"media_key":"3_1476550588234096645"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1476549220207415303","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1476550588234096645"]},"geo":{}},{"text":"As of 5 mins ago there are currently 32,190 vacancies in the NHS, and they are threatening termination of employment of 110,000 unvaxxed staff, tell me again, this is what you do in a real pandemic.","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1375,"reply_count":130,"like_count":3775,"quote_count":53},"created_at":"2021-12-29T00:25:27.000Z","id":"1475986286834065411","source":"Twitter for Android","referenced_tweets":{},"author_id":"4077167543","entities":{"mentions":{},"urls":{},"annotations":[{"start":61,"end":63,"probability":0.655,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"NHS"}],"hashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1475986286834065411","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"text":"@cmonstah @chris_notcapn I‚Äôve learned that I‚Äôd rather not know a bunch of people that I know.
