This has made subsequent allocation decisions even more challenging.The IAVG is concerned that the primary priority use of available vaccines is not consistent with the goals outlined in the Strategy to Achieve Global COVID-19 Vaccination by Mid-2022 in October 2021.[2] The group also notes that it has validated the allocation of only 730","unwound_url":"https://www.who.int/news/item/23-12-2021-achieving-70-covid-19-immunization-coverage-by-mid-2022"}],"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":9,"username":"cigmund1","id":"1364531465975963652"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{},"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","source":"Twitter for iPhone","id":"1476571373459943429","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"text":"@cigmund1 What‚Äôs 30% of 7.5 billion? https://t.co/1o5M2Oe3qX","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476306103126401042"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"1364531465975963652","geo":{}},{"author_id":"3000880387","conversation_id":"1476325893958082561","created_at":"2021-12-30T15:10:23.000Z","entities":{"urls":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":12,"username":"SceneBustin","id":"41979425"},{"start":13,"end":27,"username":"PacificChorus","id":"3311907979"},{"start":28,"end":39,"username":"SmartPig86","id":"284772460"},{"start":40,"end":54,"username":"BretWeinstein","id":"78683448"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":{},"cashtags":{}},"lang":"en","source":"Twitter for Android","id":"1476571371639652353","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"text":"@SceneBustin @PacificChorus @SmartPig86 @BretWeinstein You really think coronavirus vaccines gave 11,000 people shingles?
