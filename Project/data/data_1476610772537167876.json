This is because immune responses vary from person to person. The measles vaccine is one of the most successful vaccines, which is 99 per cent effective at preventing the disease. The effectiveness of the flu vaccine administered in the US varies widely from year to year (anywhere from 20% to 60%), depending on how well the annual vaccine attacks that year's mutation of the virus. The duration of how long a vaccine protection lasts, and how many doses might be needed for it to be effective also varies from disease to disease. For the COVID-19 vaccine, the U.S. FDA has set an effectiveness threshold of 50% to be approved or grants the emergency use authorization. A vaccine might not be 100% effective, but if most people get vaccinated then vaccination not only protects individuals, but also prevents the virus ","unwound_url":"https://health-desk.org/articles/can-vaccines-be-100-effective-against-covid-19-or-any-other-illnesses"}],"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":16,"username":"ihatetrudeau613","id":"1023670771"},{"start":17,"end":29,"username":"kardash_sam","id":"2385579373"},{"start":30,"end":46,"username":"JimWatsonOttawa","id":"60597469"},{"start":47,"end":63,"username":"PradeepMerchant","id":"426939832"}],"cashtags":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T17:50:29.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"id":"1476611665391198209","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1476610754635833346"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"207664048","geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"author_id":"390265730","text":"@annabethsk @ottawacity @OttawaHealth I'm not sure where that comes from but I know several people who have caught COVID-19 after being vaxxed and boosted.
