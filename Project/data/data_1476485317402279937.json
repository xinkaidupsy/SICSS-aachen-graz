However, few studies have reported the correlation between CT findings and long-term outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Case presentation: Herein, we conducted a 167 day long-term follow-up of CT examination on 11 patients with COVID-19 to evaluate their long-term prognosis, particularly in severe cases. We found that the course of COVID-19 can be divided into four stages according to the characteristics of CT images: 1) early stage (1–4 days), with chest CT showing quasi-circular ground-glass shadows and fine mesh shadows; 2) progressive stage (5–10 days), showing lesion spread through the axial interstitium along the bronchi and gradual diffusion to the whole lung; 3) recovery stage (11–74 days), showing gradual absorption of the fibre cord, ground-glass, and consolidation shadows; and 4) normal stage (74 days later), indicating no serious permanent lung injuries.

The age and gender related differences in OC risk helped to reveal the crucial role of estrogen signal in anticancer processes and genome stabilization in both men and women. This recognition illuminated that when a hormone is capable of preventing and curing cancer, it can cure all human diseases, including respiratory virus infection. Human epidemiology and experimental studies on animals justify that there are no quite different pathways for immune defenses against respiratory virus infection in males and females, but rather the physiologically weaker ER signaling results in an increased morbidity and mortality among men with pulmonary virus infection. In animals with respiratory virus infection, estrogen treatment silences the inflammatory reactions and decreases virus titers leading to improved survival rate.
