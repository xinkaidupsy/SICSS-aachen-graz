Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular, we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: -69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively, in the first month after primary vaccination. However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6%, 95% CI: 30.4 to 70.4%). ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have dec","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v3.full"},{"start":209,"end":232,"url":"https://t.co/wuR9hcLStY","expanded_url":"https://www.canadiancovidcarealliance.org/media-resources/the-pfizer-inoculations-for-covid-19-more-harm-than-good/","display_url":"canadiancovidcarealliance.org/media-resource‚Ä¶","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1550836324864868359/2f-zfgb8?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1550836324864868359/2f-zfgb8?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":403,"title":"The Pfizer Inoculations For COVID-19 ‚Äì More Harm Than Good ‚Äì PDF ‚Äì Canadian Covid Care Alliance","unwound_url":"https://www.canadiancovidcarealliance.org/media-resources/the-pfizer-inoculations-for-covid-19-more-harm-than-good/"}],"annotations":[{"start":140,"end":144,"probability":0.328,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Covid"}],"cashtags":{}},"text":"@RP_biggest_fan @disclosetv Two new studies also support this.
