The principles relating to decisions for children in the setting of the pandemic are the same as those for adults. The framework emphasises that decisions should be ethically consistent and apply to patients both with COVID-related and non-COVID related illness. The focus of the ethical framework provides guidance for a national emergency where there is extremely high demand and limited critical care capacity. However, it is important to note that at the time of writing (8 January 2021) there is enough paediatric critical care capacity across the UK. There was no need for prioritisation in access to paediatric critical care in the first wave of the pandemic, and it is hoped that in subsequent waves of the pandemic the same will apply.
