Symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, insomnia, respiratory problems and palpitations were particularly frequent, as also described in adults. The evidence that COVID-19 can have long-term impact children as well, including those with asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic COVID-19, highlight the need for pediatricians, mental health experts and policy makers of implementing measures to reduce impact of the pandemic on child’s health. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement no funding","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.23.21250375v1"}],"hashtags":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":11,"username":"Chaela1982","id":"1245641653521494016"},{"start":12,"end":23,"username":"AJRobbieRN","id":"1311911678209069056"},{"start":24,"end":35,"username":"Laura__Fox","id":"78246076"}],"cashtags":{}},"text":"@Chaela1982 @AJRobbieRN @Laura__Fox Buonsenso et al found:\n\n\"..
