However, neurological symptoms such as memory loss, sensory confusion, cognitive and psychiatric issues, severe headaches, and even stroke are reported in as many as 30% of cases and can persist even after the infection is over (so-called ‚Äòlong COVID‚Äô). These neurological symptoms are thought to be caused by brain inflammation, triggered by the virus infecting the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients, however we still don‚Äôt fully understand the mechanisms for these symptoms. The neurological effects of COVID-19 share many similarities to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs in which the presence of cytotoxic protein-based amyloid aggregates is a common etiological feature. Following the hypothesis that some neurological symptoms of COVID-19 may also follow an amyloid etiology we performed a bioinformatic scan of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, detecting peptide fragments that ","unwound_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.24.469537v1"}],"hashtags":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-30T05:09:48.000Z","lang":"de","text":"@HelveticFreedom @Martiprime @RonjaJansen Gibt viele zu dem Thema.
