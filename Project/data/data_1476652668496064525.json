We aimed to describe the incidence of death or new disability, functional impairment and changes in health-related quality of life of patients after COVID-19 critical illness at 6 months. Methods In a nationally representative, multicenter, prospective cohort study of COVID-19 critical illness, we determined the prevalence of death or new disability at 6 months, the primary outcome. We measured mortality, new disability and return to work with changes in the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 12L (WHODAS) and health status with the EQ5D-5LTM. Results Of 274 eligible patients, 212 were enrolled from 30 hospitals. The median age was 61 (51‚Äì70) years, and 124 (58.5%) patients were male. At 6 months, 43/160 (26.9%) patients died and 42/108 (38.9%) responding survivors reported new disability.

While some individuals recover quickly, others suffer from persistent symptoms, collectively known as long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Most PASC research has focused on hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. We used data from a diverse population-based cohort of Arizonans to estimate prevalence of PASC, defined as experiencing at least one symptom 30 days or longer, and prevalence of individual symptoms. There were 303 non-hospitalized individuals with a positive lab-confirmed COVID-19 test who were followed for a median of 61 days (range 30‚Äì250). COVID-19 positive participants were mostly female (70%), non-Hispanic white (68%), and on average 44 years old. Prevalence of PASC at 30 days post-infection was 68.7% (95% confidence interval: 63.4, 73.9). The most common symptoms were fatigue (37.5%), shortness-of-breath (37.5%), brain fog (30.8%), and stress/an","unwound_url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254347"},{"start":215,"end":238,"url":"https://t.co/1WXBbisGWT","expanded_url":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/08/210804210117.htm","display_url":"sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/‚Ä¶","images":{},"status":200,"title":"Research shows many with mild COVID-19 infections still experience long-term symptoms","description":"Data from a University of Arizona Health Sciences longitudinal study on COVID-19 shows that 67 percent of people with mild or moderate COVID-19 infection develop long COVID, with symptoms that last more than 30 days after a positive test.","unwound_url":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/08/210804210117.htm"},{"start":240,"end":263,"url":"https://t.co/5CCLUsjZ6K","expanded_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258690v3","display_url":"medrxiv.org/content/10.110‚Ä¶","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1546558703142408194/tGL8J6kE?format=png&name=orig","width":252,"height":252},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1546558703142408194/tGL8J6kE?format=png&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank","description":"There is strong evidence for brain-related pathologies in COVID-19, some of which could be a consequence of viral neurotropism, or of neuroinflammation following viral infection. Most brain imaging studies have focused on qualitative, gross pathology in moderate to severe cases, most typically carried out on hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated manner, and whether this can reveal possible mechanisms for the spread of the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible in 2021 to invite back hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit.

Smartphone use belongs to one‚Äôs daily routine, but can negatively impact physical and mental health, performance, and relationships if used excessively. The present study aimed to investigate potential correlates of problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity and the mechanisms underlying its development. Data of 516 smartphone users from Germany (Mage = 31.91, SDage = 12.96) were assessed via online surveys in April and May 2021. PSU severity was significantly negatively associated with sense of control. In contrast, it was significantly positively linked to fear of missing out (FoMO), repetitive negative thinking (RNT), and daily time spent on smartphone use. In a moderated mediation analysis, the negative relationship between sense of control and PSU severity was significantly mediated by FoMO. RNT significantly moderated the positive association between FoMO and PSU severity.
