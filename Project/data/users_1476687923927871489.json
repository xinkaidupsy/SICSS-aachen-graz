We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021.

Respiratory clinicians and scientists were at the forefront of delivering healthcare for people with COVID-19, leading efforts to understand this novel virus and disease, and developing and testing strategies to better prevent and treat it. These endeavours extended not only to the acute illness, but also to understanding the longer-term consequences. The pace of knowledge acquisition was rapid but is now maturing. This Monograph therefore provides a timely and valuable state-of-the-art summary for clinicians and scientists on our understanding of this virus and its consequences to date.
