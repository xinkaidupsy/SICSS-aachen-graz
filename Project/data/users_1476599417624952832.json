Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular, we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively, in the first month after primary vaccination. However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6%, 95% CI: 30.4 to 70.4%). ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have decl","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v2"},{"start":285,"end":308,"url":"https://t.co/3Oh3IJSVIk","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/ezralevant/status/1474106318206255113/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/3Oh3IJSVIk","images":{},"media_key":"3_1474105645309829123"}],"hashtags":{}},"created_at":"2021-12-23T19:55:08.000Z","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1474105645309829123"]},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","author_id":"85933414","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"#Vikings place starting LB Nick Vigil on COVID-19 reserve list.","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":3,"reply_count":3,"like_count":13,"quote_count":2},"id":"1476600088768270337","conversation_id":"1476600088768270337","lang":"en","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":27,"end":36,"probability":0.7129,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Nick Vigil"}],"mentions":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":[{"start":0,"end":8,"tag":"Vikings"}]},"created_at":"2021-12-30T17:04:29.000Z","referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter Web App","author_id":"4705023349","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"@Skhumba80701 Whatever, but Melissa is fooling you'll because she knows that you have little knowledge and are suspicious of the vaccine.
