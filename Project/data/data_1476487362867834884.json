Design, Setting & Participants A prospective cohort study of children <16 years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test cared for by the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network (SCHN) virtual and inpatient medical teams between 1 June – 31 October 2021. Main outcome measures Demographic and clinical data from all admitted patients and a random sample of outpatients managed under the SCHN virtual care team were analysed to identify risk factors for admission to hospital.

Twenty one percent of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic.
