The B.1.1.529 Omicron variant is rapidly emerging and has been designated a Variant of Concern (VOC). The variant is highly transmissible and partially or fully evades a spectrum of neutralising antibodies due to a high number of substitutions in the spike glycoprotein. A major question is the relative severity of disease caused by the Omicron variant compared with previous and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. To address this, a mouse model of infection that recapitulates severe disease in humans, K18-hACE2 mice, were infected with either a Pango B, Delta or Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and their relative pathogenesis compared. In contrast to mice infected with Pango B and Delta variant viruses, those infected with the Omicron variant had less severe clinical signs (weight loss), showed recovery and had a lower virus load in both the lower and upper respiratory tract.

Lipedema is a painful disease of excess loose connective tissue (fat) in limbs, almost exclusively of women, that worsens by stage, increasing lymphedema risk. Many women with lipedema have hypermobile joints suggesting a connective tissue disorder that may affect vessel structure and compliance of tissue resulting in excess fluid entering the interstitial space. It is unclear if excess fluid is present in lipedema tissue. The purpose of this study is to determine if fluid accumulates around vessels and between skin fibers in the thigh tissue of women with lipedema. Methods: Skin biopsies from the thigh and abdomen from 30 controls and 80 women with lipedema were evaluated for dermal spaces and abnormal vessel phenotype (AVP): (1) rounded endothelial cells; (2) perivascular spaces; and (3) perivascular immune cell infiltrate.

The fat in adipofascial disorders is difficult to lose by standard weight loss approaches, including lifestyle (diet, exercise), pharmacologic therapy, and even bariatric surgery, due in part to tissue fibrosis.
