SARS-CoV-2 were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, by new variants of concern (VOCs), first those with the N501Y mutation (i.e., Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants) and then the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables.

The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hos","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":92,"reply_count":7,"like_count":261,"quote_count":4},"source":"Twitter for Android","id":"1476665470220709897","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"1574782297","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-12-30T21:27:19.000Z","conversation_id":"1476666233152024581","lang":"en","text":"Antonio Gibson (hip), William Jackson (calf), and Montez Sweat (personal) DNP for #WashingtonFootball \n\nCutis Samuel, Saahdiq Charles, James Smith-Williams are limited\n\nSam Cosmi to the reserve/COVID-19 list https://t.co/XfaoXyBiae","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":0,"end":13,"probability":0.9885,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Antonio Gibson"},{"start":22,"end":36,"probability":0.9941,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"William Jackson"},{"start":50,"end":61,"probability":0.6875,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Montez Sweat"},{"start":104,"end":115,"probability":0.8198,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Cutis Samuel"},{"start":118,"end":132,"probability":0.9329,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Saahdiq Charles"},{"start":135,"end":145,"probability":0.9799,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"James Smith"},{"start":147,"end":154,"probability":0.6118,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Williams"},{"start":169,"end":177,"probability":0.8807,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Sam Cosmi"}],"urls":[{"start":208,"end":231,"url":"https://t.co/XfaoXyBiae","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/caplannfl/status/1476664432935772174","display_url":"twitter.com/caplannfl/stat…"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":[{"start":82,"end":101,"tag":"WashingtonFootball"}]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2,"reply_count":0,"like_count":3,"quote_count":0},"source":"Twitter Web App","id":"1476666233152024581","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"2958959749","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"quoted","id":"1476664432935772174"}],"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2021-11-07T21:40:54.000Z","conversation_id":"1457463094242942978","lang":"en","text":"A prominent virologist warns COVID-19 pill could unleash dangerous mutants.\n\n“You are putting a drug into circulation that is a potent mutagen at a time when we are deeply concerned about new variants.”\n\n“I can’t imagine doing anything more dangerous.”\nhttps://t.co/Fim2dxcJVk","entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":[{"start":253,"end":276,"url":"https://t.co/Fim2dxcJVk","expanded_url":"https://www.science.org/content/article/prominent-virologist-warns-covid-19-pill-could-unleash-dangerous-mutants-others-see-little-cause-alarm","display_url":"science.org/content/articl…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1545823511385706497/8vMwta2w?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1216,"height":804},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1545823511385706497/8vMwta2w?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"A prominent virologist warns COVID-19 pill could unleash dangerous mutants.
