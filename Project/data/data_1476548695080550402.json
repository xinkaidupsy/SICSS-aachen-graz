The B.1.1.529 Omicron variant is rapidly emerging and has been designated a Variant of Concern (VOC). The variant is highly transmissible and partially or fully evades a spectrum of neutralising antibodies due to a high number of substitutions in the spike glycoprotein. A major question is the relative severity of disease caused by the Omicron variant compared with previous and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. To address this, a mouse model of infection that recapitulates severe disease in humans, K18-hACE2 mice, were infected with either a Pango B, Delta or Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and their relative pathogenesis compared. In contrast to mice infected with Pango B and Delta variant viruses, those infected with the Omicron variant had less severe clinical signs (weight loss), showed recovery and had a lower virus load in both the lower and upper respiratory tract.
