Methods This was a phase 2/3 open-label, multi-centre study done across six hospitals in India. All children received two 0.5mL doses of BBV152 (Covaxin¬Æ, Bharat Biotech International Ltd., Hyderabad, India), which is the same formulation indicated in adults. Participants were monitored for adverse events, and post-vaccination blood draws were collected to assess neutralising antibodies. A total of 526 children were enrolled into Group 1 (ages 12 through 18 years, n=176), Group 2 (ages 6 through 12 years, n=175), Group 3 (ages 2 through 6 years, n=175). Findings There were no serious adverse events, deaths, or withdrawals due to an adverse event during the study.

The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario‚Äôs COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables.
