During the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in work and social behavior may have reduced women‚Äôs use of such footwear. Methods This study assessed the trend in high-heel related injuries among U.S. women, using 2016-2020 data from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission‚Äôs National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). Results In 2020 there were an estimated 6,290 high-heel related emergency department visits involving women ages 15-69, down from 16,000 per year in 2016-2019. The 2020 decline began after the start of the COVID-19 shutdowns on March 15. There was no significant change in the percentage of fractures or hospital admissions. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decline in reported injuries related to high-heeled shoes among US women. If this resulted from fewer women wearing such shoes, and such habits influence future behavior, the result may be fewer injuries in the future. ### ","unwound_url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268426v1"}],"annotations":[{"start":109,"end":110,"probability":0.5781,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"US"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"created_at":"2021-12-30T17:19:51.000Z","conversation_id":"1476603954972741635","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"source":"Twitter for iPhone","author_id":"22246333","id":"1476603954200920064","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":2,"quote_count":0},"lang":"en","text":"@dnorm34 Hey David, I imagine they‚Äôre getting tested for the novel coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19.
